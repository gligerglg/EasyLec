#Importance

Just think you are a student in a university. Sure, you may have lectures everyday or couple of days for a week. 
Now this is the question, what will happen if you receive a phone call or couple of messages to your mobile device 
while you are in a lecture. Oh yeah! Your device will be ringing until you get it. 
The worst part is you will embarrass among other friends or maybe you will have to hand over your device to the lecturer. 
Itâ€™s a nightmare right? 
  So what kind of solution do we have? 
You can make your device silent before you go to your lecture. 
But you have to do this for each lecture and everyday! Maybe you will forget to do this. 
What if we have some solution to do this process automatically. Now you do have. 
EasyLec will turn your mobile device into silent mode in lecture hours and recover it again in normal times. Pretty nice right?
